This Flutter-based project implements a fully functional chat application that allows users to create accounts, log in, and interact with different chat rooms and channels. The application leverages Firebase Firestore for user authentication and Firestore collections for managing user data. The actual chat messages are stored and synchronized using Firebase Realtime Database.
